      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am very passionate about electronics, particularly embedded systems. 
         I studied computer engineering and work with basic ARM processors and FPGA's in my free time, 
         I also have education in 3D modeling and enjoy working with 3D printing and other robotic systems. 
         I am currently in my first year of Utah State University's Master's of Engineering in Computer Engineering. 
         I am specifically emphasizing in embedded systems, VLSI design, and Computer Architecture. 
         I enjoy learning new programming concepts and creating new capabilities for electronic systems.</p>
